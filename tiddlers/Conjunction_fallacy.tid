title: Conjunction fallacy
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The //conjunction fallacy// is rating the probability P(A,B) higher than the probability P(B) even though it is a theorem that P(A,B) &#8804; P(B).

Adding detail can make a scenario //sound more plausible//, even though the event necessarily //becomes less probable//.
