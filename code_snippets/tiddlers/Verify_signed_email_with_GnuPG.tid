type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Save the email into a plaintext file and remove any spaces/linebreaks from the signature.

You then need the public key. This can either be copied into a plaintext file (with a .sig extension) or imported from a key server.

To import from a text file;

```
gpg --import <key.asc>
```

To add from a server;

```
gpg --recv-keys <Key ID>
```

To confirm that the key has been added, the following returns a list of keys available to gpg (the ''keyring'').

```
gpg --list-keys
```

Finally, to verify a file;

```
gpg <key file> --verify <signed file>
```
